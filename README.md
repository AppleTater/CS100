Title:
  - Musical *f*orte
  
App:
  - JetBrains: IntelliJ IDEA
  
Importance and Interest:
  - Thanks to streaming services such as Spotify, music has ingrained itself within the lives of many people. We are the first generation to have an entire library and geography of music at our fingertips and Spotify's surveys reveal that an overwhelming majority of users pride themselves on being open-minded and enjoying music that spans across multiple genres. We like to think that our personal taste in music reflects this diversity in genres and we'd like to know more about the songs we can't get enough of, as well as discover new music that closely matches what we already love. The issue presents itself: third party platforms offer insight into our top songs, artists, and genres but lack the ability to intelligently suggest new music. Our goal is to develop a program that can make preference-based suggestions and output links to new releases and undiscovered playlists.
    
 Language and Tools:
  - Java (IntelliJ IDEA)
  - Spotify API

Input and Output
  - In: genre of music / artist
  - Out: similar genre of music / similar artists as 'advice'

Design Patterns:
  - Visitor Pattern: Counting the total number of songs
  - Decorator Pattern: Adding messages and a title to the outputted file
  - Composite Pattern: Making outputs for new and featured songs
  
 Goal:
  - Utilize Spotify's public API to recommend songs based on user input and put the recommended songs onto files.
