# **MUSICAL *f*ORTE**

## CS 100 Programming Project

### Group Members:
  - #### Dylan Han (dhan060@ucr.edu)
  - #### Roy Feng (rfeng016@ucr.edu)
  - #### Jasmine Lau (jlau053@ucr.edu)

### Goal:
  - ##### Utilize Spotify's public API to recommend songs based on user input and put the recommended songs onto files.
  
### Importance and Interest:

- Thanks to streaming services such as Spotify, music has ingrained itself within the lives of many people. We are the first generation to have an entire library and geography of music at our fingertips and Spotify's surveys reveal that an overwhelming majority of users pride themselves on being open-minded and enjoying music that spans across multiple genres. We like to think that our personal taste in music reflects this diversity in genres and we'd like to know more about the songs we can't get enough of, as well as discover new music that closely matches what we already love. The issue presents itself: third party platforms offer insight into our top songs, artists, and genres but lack the ability to intelligently suggest new music.

### Design Patterns Used:
  1. Composite Pattern (Dylan Han): Making outputs for new and featured songs
  2. Visitor Pattern (Roy Feng): Counting the total number of songs
  3. Decorator Pattern (Jasmine Lau): Adding messages and a title to the outputted file
